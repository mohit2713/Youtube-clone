4. react-router-dom



## Youtube Suggestion Search api
1. Every suggestion api uses `Debouncing`.

# if difference between 2 key strokes is <200ms - Decline api call.
# 200ms makes an api call

2.  typing slow = 200ms (flipcart)
    typing fast = 30ms (youyube)

3. Performance 
    iphone pro max = 14 letter * 1000 = 14000
    with debouncing = 3 API calls * 1000 = 3000 



## Header Component/ Search suggestion/ Debouncing:-

* When search - i
* render the component
* useEffect();
* start timer => make api call after 200ms

* when search - ip
* destroy the component (useEffect return method) => after every re-render
* re-render the component
* useEffect()
* Start timer => make api call after 200ms


## ...action.payload => javascript es6 spread operator..


## Store search cache:-
1. We will store our all api results in redux store so that our api will not call again and again on every backspace.

## useMemo
1. Used to cache the result of calculations between the re-render to increase th performance of our app.
2. IF our compoent has some heavy operations and our component performing the heavy operations on very re-render then it will slow down our app.
3. synatx const prime = useMemo(()=>{},dependencies)
4. It takes an call back function and a dependencies and returns a value.
5. example see demo1.js
6. on every re-render the function in useMemo will not be called untill its dependency changes.


## useCallBack
1. Used to cache the function definition between the re-render to increase th performance of our app.
2. IF our compoent has some heavy functions definition and our component calling that the heavy functions definition on very re-render then it will slow down our app.
3. synatx const prime = useCallb(function,dependencies)
4. It takes function and  a dependencies and it returns a function.

## useRef
1. useRef is a React Hook that lets you reference a value thatâ€™s not needed for rendering.

2. syntax : const ref = useRef(initialValue)

3. returns an ref object with single property.
        eg ref {
            current:initialvalue
           }
4. On the next renders, useRef will return the same object.
