# Getting Started with Create React App

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Notes:-


# Layout:-
1. HEAD COMPONENT
2. BODY COMPONENT 
    HAMBURGER MENU
    FILTER BUTTONS
    VIDEO COMPONENT/ WATCH COMPONENT


# Teckstack
1. React
2. Tailwind
3. redux toolkit , react redux
4. react-router-dom



## Youtube Suggestion Search api
1. Every suggestion api uses `Debouncing`.

# if difference between 2 key strokes is <200ms - Decline api call.
# 200ms makes an api call

2.  typing slow = 200ms (flipcart)
    typing fast = 30ms (youyube)

3. Performance 
    iphone pro max = 14 letter * 1000 = 14000
    with debouncing = 3 API calls * 1000 = 3000 



## Header Component/ Search suggestion/ Debouncing:-

* When search - i
* render the component
* useEffect();
* start timer => make api call after 200ms

* when search - ip
* destroy the component (useEffect return method) => after every re-render
* re-render the component
* useEffect()
* Start timer => make api call after 200ms


## ...action.payload => javascript es6 spread operator..


## Store search cache:-
1. We will store our all api results in redux store so that our api will not call again and again on every backspace.
